CHESS BOARD

A small program used to print a 8x8 black-white chess board on a terminal.
The program doesn't use any graphic library. Instead, it uses the terminal's own capability (which is changing background color) to display the board.

Note: That the board is really square or not depends on the terminal's font type and font size.
Quite *square* with Monospace 10 (in Ubuntu).

Build: ./make
Use: ./chess_board
